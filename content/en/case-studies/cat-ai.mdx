### System Overview

The CAT-AI system orchestrates ingestion from legacy cataloging systems, applies AI classification, and routes enrichment tasks to librarians for final validation. A governance layer monitors data quality, audit trails, and interoperability.

### Architecture Highlights

- Event-driven metadata pipeline
- Human-in-the-loop verification
- Automated authority reconciliation
