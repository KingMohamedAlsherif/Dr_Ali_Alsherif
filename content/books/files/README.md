# Book files (local only)

PDFs for the book reader are intentionally not tracked in Git to keep the repo PR-friendly.

Place the real files locally in this folder with the exact filenames referenced by `content/*/books/*.mdx`:

- `ai-cataloging.pdf`
- `digital-repositories.pdf`
- `knowledge-governance.pdf`

If these files are missing, the UI will show a friendly notice instead of the reader.
